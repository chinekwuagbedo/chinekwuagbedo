# I'm Simone

I'm a **Biomedical Engineering student at Texas A&M** with a passion for building cool things—especially games—and diving deep within the crossroads of biology and computer science.

## What I'm About

What I'm currently using this for is **game development**. You'll find some of my games here on GitHub, but I've got plenty more tucked away on my hard drive that didn't quite make the cut for upload (Unity has their own cloud as well). Whether it's 3D platformers or just a simple dialogue oriented game, I love the problem-solving and creativity involved.

Beyond games, I'm equally passionate about **biomedical engineering and bioinformatics**—I'm currently doing undergraduate research on felid sex chromosomes in the Texas A&M Department of Veterinary Integrative Biosciences.

## My Toolkit

**Languages I'm solid with:**
- **Java** (seriously, I've got extensive experience here, my go-to)
- C++** / C#
- Python
- R** (not my strong suit)
- Bash

**Tools & Frameworks:**
- Unity (game jams are my jam)
- AutoCAD**

**Certs:** IT Java Specialist, Microsoft Office 365 Specialist

## What You'll Find Here

-  **Game projects** (the ones I actually uploaded)
-  **Bioinformatics & research code**
-  **Side projects & experiments**
-  **Educational tools** 

## Currently...

-  Publishing research on felid chromosomes with the Texas A&M Dept. of Veterinary Integrative Biosciences
-  Starting my degree with a minor in Computer Science
-  Always learning new tech and pushing my game dev skills further
